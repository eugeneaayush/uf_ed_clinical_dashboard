# UF ED Clinical Dashboard

## What this is
React SPA dashboard for UF Health's five emergency departments. Pre-computed
JSON payloads from a Python/pandas aggregator drive 28 metrics × 22 slices
plus per-location Daily Activity Reports that replicate the Shands PDF.

Deployed to Firebase Hosting. Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind +
Recharts. Python 3.12 + pandas for the pipeline.

## Key paths
- `scripts/aggregate.py` — the aggregator. Emits `public/data/**/*.json`.
- `src/pages/Summary.tsx` — Oracle-style landing view.
- `src/pages/MetricsIndex.tsx`, `MetricDetail.tsx` — 28 metrics, parameterized.
- `src/pages/ConditionsIndex.tsx`, `ConditionDetail.tsx` — ICD-10 drill-downs.
- `src/pages/DailyReport.tsx` — Shands PDF replication, 7 sub-tabs.
- `src/lib/types.ts` — all payload interfaces.
- `src/lib/data.ts` — React hooks for loading payloads.
- `src/components/Shell.tsx` — masthead, footer, nav.

## Data
- `data_raw/clinical_data.csv` — single master clinical feed, FY17 → present
  (~973 MB, 1.46M rows). **Rows are not unique by Encounter # (CSN)** — the
  export replicates identical rows for a subset of encounters. `load_encounters`
  collapses each CSN to one row at load time (`drop_duplicates(keep="first")`),
  yielding ~389K distinct encounters. Every downstream metric (counts, rates,
  medians, groupings) then operates on one-row-per-encounter data automatically.
- `data_raw/BO_billing_FY26.csv` + `BO_billing_FY17_FY25.csv` — encounter-billing
  data (shared schema). Used in Phase 4 for charge/collection/RVU roll-ups.
- UF fiscal year runs Jul 1 → Jun 30 (e.g. FY26 = Jul 1 2025 → Jun 30 2026).
  `load_encounters` derives `fiscal_year` and `fy_quarter` columns from Arrival
  DateTime.
- **CSN-distinct semantics**: `Encounters` = `df["Encounter # (CSN)"].nunique()`.
  `LWBS` = distinct CSNs with `LWBS Flag == "Y"`. Admits = distinct CSNs with
  `Final ED Disposition ∈ {"ADMIT", "PRESENTED TO ADMIT SERVICE"}`. Discharges
  = distinct CSNs with `Final ED Disposition == "DISCHARGE"`. Because dedup
  runs at load time these all reduce to simple pandas ops — no per-metric
  CSN-awareness logic needed.
- BO pull lacks `Admit Unit` and `Admit Service` columns — MD→Order section
  in Daily Report shows a graceful empty state until those are added.

## Payload layout
The aggregator emits per-FY payload directories and mirrors the latest FY to
the top level for backward compatibility:
- `public/data/index.json` — `{ available_fys, current_fy, generated_at }`.
- `public/data/fy{17..26}/` — one directory per fiscal year containing
  `meta.json`, `summary.json`, `metrics/<slug>/*.json`, `conditions/<slug>.json`.
  Only the latest FY additionally carries `daily/*.json`.
- `public/data/{meta,summary}.json`, `public/data/{metrics,conditions,daily}/` —
  byte-identical copies of the latest FY's payloads. Hooks in `src/lib/data.ts`
  still point here; swap them when Phase 2 lands the FY picker.
- Metric payloads include a `quarterly` array (in addition to `monthly`)
  because medians/P90 don't compose from monthly aggregates.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — dev server on :5173
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run aggregate` — regenerate all payloads
- `npm run deploy` — build + firebase deploy

## Style notes
- UF brand colors: `#0021A5` (blue), `#FA4616` (orange).
- Fonts: IBM Plex Sans/Mono, Anybody display font.
- Recharts animations are DISABLED in DailyReport (deterministic paint for
  screenshots + smoother tab switching). Keep it that way unless there's a
  specific reason.
- The avg-acuity-by-location donut on Summary uses ESI tinting (red = sicker,
  blue = less acute). Do not swap to location brand colors.

## Known
- ADULT ED max-wait-hours line in 1F holds at 22h+ all 24 hours of 4/15/26 —
  this is the real-time boarding crisis visualization. It's the signal to
  surface with Frank/Dr. Becker.
